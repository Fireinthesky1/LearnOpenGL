# LearnOpenGL

This project began on 6/24/2022. One of my life goals is to become a game enginer developer and this
is my first major step towards accomplishing that. In this project I will be going through learn openGL.com.
For this initial commit I have two triangles renderered using two separate fragment shaders etc. Later commits
will be have more details.
